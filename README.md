## ðŸ“‚ Data Requirements

The dataset and cleaned data is **not included** in this repository due to size constraints.
To run the project:
1. **Download the data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12HL7HRkJhm1drbv7hC9eZDDpTTTIKZP7).** This folder hosts the raw datasets used for this project. Should you wish to also download the cleaned datasets which are the product of Data Strategist Pretest - Read, Collect, Clean.ipynb you can do so here [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rH7Z1C3Io3zywpsV3ITENFcCK-Y6z7UM) 
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
[For RAW datasets]
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name.basics.tsv.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title.basics.tsv.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title.principals.tsv.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title.ratings.tsv.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv
â””â”€â”€ app.py
```
```
[For CLEANED datasets]
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ movies_data.csv

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard/movie_dashboard_streamlit.py
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The dashboard is optimized for data filtered through sidebar controls
- Some visualizations may take time to load due to large datasets, but should be cached on first run for better performance
